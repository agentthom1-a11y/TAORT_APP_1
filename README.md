# TAORT_APP_1

This repository now includes a minimal command-line Tarot app.

## Usage

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies (none required for the MVP). Run the app:

```
python -m tarot_app.cli
```

You will be prompted to draw a card and receive a brief summary, actions, and mantra.

## Development

Run tests with:

```
pytest
```
